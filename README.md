# WikipediaViewer

[See the live app](https://larry-cherry.github.io/WikipediaViewer/)

## Goal of the app
* The purpose of this app is to make an easy means of searching wikipedia articles.

## Challenges
* Wikipedia API: Perhaps one of the greatest challenges was learning how to use the Wiki API. A very helpful was the [API Sandbox](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox). This helped with learning how the API functioned.
* CORS: Just like in my weather app CORS was an issue once again. I got around this issue by updating my [Rails API](https://github.com/larry-cherry/Rails-API) to handle request. This time around request were handled much faster. The only time lag was an issue was with the random query feature but that appears to be more of an issue with Wikipedia than my API.
